<p>Repeat 2 more times.</p>

<hr>

<p>Recommended tune: Any good strathspey or reel.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: The feel of this dance is considerably different when danced as a strathspey versus a reel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Dance as a medley--once through the strathspey followed by once through the reel. Repeat 2 more times.</li>
<li>Option 2: Dance the strathspey (3 times) followed immediately by the reel (3 times).</li>
<li>Option 3: Dance the reel 6 times through, because of its shortness.</li>
</ul>
