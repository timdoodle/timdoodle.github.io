<p>Recommended tune: Any good jig.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: This dance was written as a first dance with a reel of three.
  It is expected that the students are already familiar with a figure of eight.<br>
  The dance is named after the place (The Quicksilver Dance Center) at which the Austin Scottish Country Dancers held their classes (1998-2006).</p>
