<p>Note: This dance was devised in the Fireside Lounge of the St. Jerome's University at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Canada.
  The Fireside Lounge is where after-parties were held during the Teachers' Association (Canada) Summer School 2000.
  People arrive at the after-party and join a group for chatting.
  As the party continues people leave that group to join another group while others wander from group to group searching for conversation in which they can participate.
<p>The dance idea was suggested by Karen Baisden of Seattle, Washington, USA.</p>
